📘 Project Description :

Emotion-Aware Empathetic Support Chatbot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)–based conversational system designed to deliver emotionally adaptive and context-sensitive responses for mental well-being support.

The system analyzes user input to identify underlying emotional states, maps them to structured emotional representations, and retrieves semantically and emotionally relevant knowledge from curated conversational data. Using this retrieved context, the chatbot generates empathetic, supportive, and human-centered responses.

The framework is intentionally non-diagnostic and non-clinical, focusing on emotional understanding, reflective dialogue, and ethical interaction design rather than medical or therapeutic intervention.

By combining emotion modeling with retrieval-based grounding, the system aims to improve conversational coherence, emotional alignment, and response reliability in sensitive dialogue scenarios.

#Purpose:
A non-clinical conversational assistant that:

- detects user emotion
- retrieves emotionally similar past dialogues
- synthesizes empathetic responses
- adapts tone and structure dynamically
  🚫 No diagnosis
  🚫 No treatment
  ✅ Emotional validation only

#Primary Dataset
✅ EmpatheticDialogues (Facebook AI)

Each entry contains:

- situation description
- speaker utterance
- listener empathetic reply
- emotion label (sad, angry, anxious, etc.)
- This dataset is perfect for your idea.

We will use it for:

- emotion pattern learning
- retrieval grounding
- empathy response modeling
